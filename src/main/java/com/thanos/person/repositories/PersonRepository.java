/*
 * Spring Data JPA focuses on using JPA to store data in a relational database. 
 * Its most compelling feature is the ability to create repository implementations automatically, 
 * at runtime, from a repository interface.
 * 
 * Repository is the abstraction we use to save and retrieve things from our database
 * JpaRepository interface gets the entity class type and the type of the id.
 * 
 * Also I need the @Repository annotation. It tells spring that this is a repository.
 * It is the thing we can use to interact with the persistence layer. It also adds the
 * repository to the application context in order to get injected where needed.
